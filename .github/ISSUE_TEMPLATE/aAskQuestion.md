STOP RIGHT HERE - DO NOT CREATE A TICKET FOR A QUESTION ON THIS REPOSITORY

The best routes for getting questions answered when the documentation doesn't serve what you need is the mailing list or in chat:

- email - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chocolatey
- chat - https://gitter.im/chocolatey/chocolatey.org

NOTE: Keep in mind we have an etiquette regarding communication that we expect folks to observe when they are looking for support in the Chocolatey community - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-requests/blob/master/README.md#etiquette-regarding-communication
